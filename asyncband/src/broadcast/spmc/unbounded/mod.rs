//! An unbounded fan-out channel with one sender and many receivers.
//!
//! A send publishes one value to every receiver that exists at that moment. Receivers advance
//! independently, and a receiver created later starts with the next value rather than replaying
//! earlier values. The sender is not [`Clone`]; [`UnboundedSender::send`] takes `&mut self` so a
//! second producer cannot exist at compile time.
//!
//! # Backlog and memory
//!
//! Published values remain in the shared backlog until every receiver that was eligible for them
//! has advanced past them or been dropped. Because sending has no capacity limit, one stalled
//! receiver can make that backlog exhaust available memory.
//! [`UnboundedSender::retained_message_count`] reports its current length. Use [`bounded`] when
//! the producer should wait for the slowest receiver instead of growing the backlog.
//!
//! # Receivers
//!
//! [`UnboundedSender::subscribe`] and [`UnboundedReceiver::resubscribe`] add a receiver at the
//! current publication boundary. They do not copy another receiver's unread backlog.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use asyncband::broadcast::spmc::TryRecvError;
//! use asyncband::broadcast::spmc::unbounded;
//!
//! let (mut publisher, mut early) = unbounded();
//! publisher.send("before subscription");
//!
//! let mut late = publisher.subscribe();
//! publisher.send("after subscription");
//!
//! assert_eq!(early.try_recv(), Ok("before subscription"));
//! assert_eq!(early.try_recv(), Ok("after subscription"));
//! assert_eq!(late.try_recv(), Ok("after subscription"));
//! assert_eq!(late.try_recv(), Err(TryRecvError::Empty));
//! ```
//!
