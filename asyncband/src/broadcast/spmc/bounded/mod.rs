//! A single-producer multi-consumer broadcast channel with a bounded buffer.
//!
//! Each message sent is received by all active receivers. Nothing is ever displaced to make room,
//! so a receive never reports lag; instead the channel retains at most `capacity` messages and
//! makes the producer wait. The sender is not [`Clone`]; [`BoundedSender::send`] and
//! [`BoundedSender::try_send`] take `&mut self` so a second producer cannot exist at compile time.
//!
//! # Capacity
//!
//! Capacity counts the *shared* backlog — the messages retained because the slowest active
//! receiver has not read them yet — not messages per receiver. Adding receivers therefore does not
//! consume capacity; falling behind does.
//!
//! Because the backlog is shared, a single receiver that stops draining stalls the producer,
//! however many other receivers are keeping up. That is what "the slowest subscription exerts
//! backpressure" means, and it is the trade a lossless bounded broadcast makes. Drop a receiver
//! that will not drain, and its backlog is released immediately.
//!
//! If no receivers are active the channel retains nothing, so a send never waits.
//!
//! A successful receive releases its subscription's claim before returning the value; processing
//! that value afterward does not hold capacity. The capacity limit excludes pending sends and
//! values already handed to application code.
//!
//! # Receivers
//!
//! Each receiver has an independent cursor. Use [`BoundedSender::subscribe`] or
//! [`BoundedReceiver::resubscribe`] to create a receiver that starts at the current tail. A new
//! subscription never sees messages published before it existed.
//!
//! [`BoundedSender::send`] holds `&mut self` while it waits, so the sender cannot
//! [`subscribe`](BoundedSender::subscribe) until that send completes. Create the extra
//! subscription from a live receiver with [`BoundedReceiver::resubscribe`] instead.
//!
//! # Cancel safety
//!
//! Publication itself is one indivisible step, so cancelling a send can never leave a gap in the
//! committed order. Cancelling a pending `recv` does not advance the subscription cursor.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Basic usage:
//!
//! ```
//! use asyncband::broadcast::spmc;
//!
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() {
//! let (mut tx, mut rx1) = spmc::bounded(4);
//! let mut rx2 = tx.subscribe();
//!
//! tx.send(10).await;
//! tx.send(20).await;
//!
//! assert_eq!(rx1.recv().await, Ok(10));
//! assert_eq!(rx1.recv().await, Ok(20));
//! assert_eq!(rx2.recv().await, Ok(10));
//! assert_eq!(rx2.recv().await, Ok(20));
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The slowest receiver holds the capacity:
//!
//! ```
//! use asyncband::broadcast::spmc;
//! use asyncband::broadcast::spmc::TrySendError;
//!
//! let (mut tx, mut rx1) = spmc::bounded(2);
//! let rx2 = tx.subscribe();
//!
//! tx.try_send(1).unwrap();
//! tx.try_send(2).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(tx.try_send(3), Err(TrySendError::Full(3)));
//!
//! // `rx1` draining is not enough: `rx2` has read neither message, so both stay retained.
//! assert_eq!(rx1.try_recv(), Ok(1));
//! assert_eq!(tx.retained_message_count(), 2);
//! assert_eq!(tx.try_send(3), Err(TrySendError::Full(3)));
//!
//! // Dropping the lagging receiver releases the backlog only it was holding. `rx1` has still not
//! // read the second message, so that one stays.
//! drop(rx2);
//! assert_eq!(tx.retained_message_count(), 1);
//! tx.try_send(3).unwrap();
//! ```
